# Releases

To trigger a release, merge a commit to `main` that follows [Conventional
Commits][]. In short,

- `fix:` to trigger a patch release
- `feat:` to trigger a minor release
- `<type>!:` or use a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to trigger a major release

We don't enforce conventional commits generally (though you are free do so),
it's only required if you want to trigger release.
